# Sondre Nj√•stad - Professional Backend and IoT Developer

## Professional Summary
I am a highly experienced backend and IoT developer with a strong background in Linux, .NET, SQL, Azure, REST, BLE, MQTT, and message encoding/decoding. I currently work as a senior developer at Effera AS in the IIoT Team, where I am responsible for choosing and designing the hardware we use. I have extensive experience working with BLE devices and BLE Beacon technology, as well as Angular and Cordova app development for iOS and Android. 

## Work Experience
### Effera AS
- Edge computing device: "Effera Machine Controller 2". I was responsible for writing the code that interacts with the IO and other hardware on the machine, as well as participating in the design of the device specification. 
- iOS/Android app: "Effera Insight". I was part of a medium-sized team that developed the web app using Angular and Cordova.

### 3B Fibreglass Norway
- Raw material tracking system: "3B Barcode". I developed an Android application that tracked the usage of raw materials in the plant using barcode/RFID scanners.
- Cafeteria system: "3B Cafeteria". I digitalized the cafeteria purchasing process using a touch screen and RFID reader by creating an Android application that used employees' check-in cards. 

## Personal Projects
In my spare time, I enjoy working on my smart home using Home Assistant, participating in CTFs, and self-hosting services such as storage, databases, routers, and firewalls. I have also made major contributions to the open-source project Bluelinky on GitHub, specifically for the EU fundament.
