## Professional Summary
I am a highly experienced backend and IoT developer with a strong background in Linux, .NET, SQL, Azure, REST, BLE, MQTT, and message encoding/decoding. I currently work as a senior developer at Effera AS in the IIoT Team, where I am responsible for choosing and designing the hardware we use, as well as developing software for out edge systems. I have extensive experience working with BLE devices and BLE Beacon technology, as well as some experience with Angular and Cordova app development for iOS and Android. 

## Work Experience
## Effera AS
##Senior Developer in the IIoT Team (January 2019 - present)

### Projects

#### Effera Machine Controller 2 - Edge computing device
In this project, I was responsible for writing the code that interacts with the IO and other hardware on the machine. I was also involved in the designing of the device specification that would define the functionality of the device.

#### Effera Insight - iOS/Android app
In this project, I was part of a medium-sized team working on the development of the web app using Angular and Cordova technologies.

#### Effera Ventilation
In the Effera Ventilation project, I was responsible for the damper and fan controller backend and edge device. I also worked on the Angular app and maintained it after its release.

#### Effera Caterpillar Wiring harness
In Effera, I designed and produced a prototype of a wiring harness that was approved for official installation at PON CAT (Caterpillar Norway). The harness was designed to install "Effera Machine Controller 2" quickly and without voiding the warranty given by Caterpillar.

## 3B Fibreglass Norway

#### 3B Barcode - Raw material tracking system
I developed an Android application for barcode/RFID scanners that tracked the usage of the raw materials used in the plant.

#### 3B Cafeteria
I digitalized the process of purchasing food in the cafeteria using a touch screen and an RFID reader by using the employees check-in card.

#### 3B Portal
3B Portal is a shortcut portal for all the files and programs used in 3B. It's managed from a central database (SQL) and has version control to make sure everyone has the latest version of the files distributed.

## Hobbies
On my spare time, I enjoy working with my smart home running Home Assistant. I built a Magic Mirror ([magicmirror.builders](https://magicmirror.builders/)) and also built my own garage gate controller with status and control. I also enjoy participating in CTFs and self-hosting services like storage, databases, routers, and doing my firewall and networking from scratch. I have made significant contributions to the open source project Bluelinky on GitHub, doing most of the EU fundamentals.
